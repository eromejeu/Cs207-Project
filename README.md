# Cs207-Project
Interactive Gadget Project

This project is a flexy glowing wearable with integrated circuits, which has been created by a 3D printer using conductive filament material for the project. It was built for imaginative ideas, and a way for viewers to be innovative with this idea. Its a 3D printed LED flexible glove with conductive filament, that allows the user to use hand motions containing LED's in any imaginative way possible.

The picture of my project would be in the other file, named 3dmodel.jpg . Not finished due to illness issues
